Carry Bit: Set for Shift and Rotate operations only. If the most significant bit is on before the operation.
Zero Bit: If the result of Arithmetic, logical, Shift and Rotate operations is Zero.
Sign Bit: If the result of Arithmetic, logical, Shift and Rotate operations is Negative.
Overflow Bit: If the result of Arithmetic and logical operations is either carry in or carry out of the most significant bit.

1.	Data base > Data Limit
2.	PC > CC
